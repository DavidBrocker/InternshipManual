The most important and strongest feeling we can have is \"love\" and when we want to express real affection for another person, place, group, activity, company, organization, or anything else, we say \"I love that.\" It is the highest form of praise we can offer. The equals sign connects one's love to that object of affection. And we believe in the idea that \"the more love you give, the more you get in return.\" Our strategy is one of differentiation built on quality, innovative design, and core message. I want people, e.g. you, to see the company as honest, truthful, loyal, generous, and benevolent.\n5\n\n\nThe Learning Experience\nMassapequa\n \n \n \n5\n\n\nThe Little Drifter\nMassapequa Park\n\n6\n\n\nThe Marfan Foundation\nPort Washington\nIntern will be responsible for a variety of phone and online support groups for people with Marfan syndrome and their families.

This evaluation will be completed at the end of the course and will have no impact on students’ grades/evaluations. The purpose of the evaluation is two-fold:\n\nTo maintain quality in the internship program/eliminate internship sites that provide inadequate experience; and\nTo inform future students about the opportunities afforded by various internship sites. The evaluations will be read by the internship coordinator and made available to future interns seeking placement in the same organization. For the evaluations to be useful, we ask that students provide candid, comprehensive feedback on their internship experience."

    "text": "Research Placements\nIf you are planning to do research, there are two options: research assistant (helping a faculty member with their ongoing research) or independent project (completing your OWN research project under the mentorship of a faculty member). Students should do research because is it developmentally/educationally appropriate and in line with their future goals. Research is best for those students planning graduate school in experimental psychology and/or a PhD in any field. If you have not completed research methods, you ARE NOT ELIGIBLE to do a research internship.\nIf you are planning a research experience, you should reach out to a faculty member to discuss your research/graduate school/career interests. The faculty member does not need to be a member of the Psychology Department (e.g., you may work with Business faculty). Faculty will accept research assistants or agree to mentor independent projects based on available resources and the nature of the research they are conducting in each semester.\nStudents must have research placements confirmed with a faculty mentor no later than 2 weeks before the semester begins. Students who do not secure a research placement with a faculty member at least two weeks before the semester begins will be required to seek a non-research placement."

    "text": "Description:\nStudents selecting this option will work in a local organization and apply the knowledge gained in the classroom to a “real world” environment. Internships allow students to test career intentions, improve skills in both written and oral communications, develop their applied psychology skills, and acquire project experience that will be useful when seeking employment or graduate studies. There are many types of organizations that are appropriate for internships (e.g., businesses with a human resource department, counseling centers, schools). The student’s career goals and interests should determine the type of organization selected. Learning and gaining professional experience are the major goals of an internship. Students must be assigned meaningful experiences that contribute to their learning. It is important that the work assigned be matched to the interests and skill level of the student as well as the needs of the organization/business offering the internship. Organizations are expected to provide adequate orientation, training, supervision and feedback for students."
