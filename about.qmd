## Logging Hours

```{webr-r}

time_worked <- function(x){
  # Code to divide by 60
  tw <- round(x/60,2) 
  tw
  print(paste0("You worked ", x, 
               " minutes. Please log ",
               tw," in Axiom"))
}
# Change this!
time_worked(70)

plot(rnorm(10,4,2))
```

R can be integrated into 'static' sites with dynamic content. For example, this could be used to demonstrate the following concepts.

### Sampling Distributions

```{webr-r}

# Here is a sample of 20 items from a population of 100
# The mean of the sample is 5. Change the sample taken to see
# how it affects the mean of the sample
# Sample of 100 items with mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2.
x <- rnorm(100,5,2)

xs<- sample(x,20)

hist(xs, 
main = "Histogram of Sample Compared to Population",
xlab = "Value")
abline(v = mean(xs), 
       col = "blue")
```
