Alternative activities must meet the basic learning objectives of an Internship/Senior Project experience below.\nStudent Preparation:\nPrior to the start of the semester, identify a project/activity that you would like to work on during the semester and a supervisor/faculty member with whom you would like to work. Contact the supervisor/faculty member to express your interest and determine whether their schedule and expertise will permit them to work with you during the semester. The student should then meet with the supervisor/faculty mentor to create a tentative learning contract which documents planned semester activities and their connection to the learning objectives. The learning contract should be submitted to the internship coordinator for approval before work begins. Approval of alternate projects is at the discretion of the internship coordinator."
